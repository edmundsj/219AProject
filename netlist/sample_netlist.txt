# NETLIST v1:
# Date Created: 11/23/2019
# Author: Jordan Edmunds, jordan.e@berkeley.edu

# This is a sample netlist, which is parsed by the python interpreter
# Lines starting with a pound sign are ignored, just like in python.

# There is one mandatory plane, the 'object' plane. This plane contains
# the 'input' electromagnetic field. This might be a simple plane wave,
# a Gaussian beam,

# This netlist is modeled after the SPICE netlists used in circuit analysis.
# The reason for this is that it is extremely simple and highly extensible.
# The goal is to define your elements and basic geometries in this netlist,
# without needing to know the underlying representation of the code.

# This will allow even total amateurs to python to use this software, as it
# requires only that you interact with (write) the netlist, and then run
# the software using the netlist as an input.

# Instead of 'nodes', as in circuit analysis, we have 'planes'. These
# are conceptually identical to nodes in a circuit, and are just
# cartesian x/y planes.

# The format of components is this:
# <letter><name> <n1> <n2> [model_name] [parameter_values]

# All units are assumed to be in millimeters if not given, or SI units
# if a prefix is given explicitly.

# For now, we will deal only with thin elements, or elements that
# can be compressed into a single 2D complex amplitude/phase mask.
# These need not be axi-symmetric so long as they are functions of only
# x and y.

# Example: a thin fresnel lens placed at some plane (plane 1)
# Everything is assumed to start at the coordinate z=0, and all element
# locations are defined relative to this origin. Elements cannot be at 
# negative locations. There is always a plane (plane 0, or P0)

# First (although we can put this wherever we want), we define our source:
# W: Plane wave
# All we need is a wavelength and a location for a plane wave.
# In the future we will add tilt as an option to the plane wave and gaussian beams.
W1 0mm 500nm

# P0 0mm	# Plane 0 - located at z=0mm
# P1 20mm 	# Plane 1 - located at z=20mm
P1 1000mm		# Plane 2 - located at z=60mm
P2 10000mm	
P3 100000mm
P4 1000000mm	
P5 10000000mm

# G: Gaussian beam
# This requires a position, wavelength, and beam waist in that order.
# Gaussian beam of 700nm wavelength located at z=0mm with a waist w0=5mm
# G1 0mm 700nm 5mm # Gaussian beam located at 0mm with a 5mm waist

# L: Ideal (quadratic phase) lens
# L1 20mm 40mm	# Lens 1 - located at z=20mm, with a focal length of 40mm.

# C: Circular aperture
# C<name> <location> <diameter>
#C1 0.1mm 1mm

# R: Rectangular aperture
# R<name> <location> <width_x> <width_y>
# R1 0.1mm 1mm

# S: Square aperture
# S<name> <location> <width>
S1 0mm 100mm
